# TTV-Opener
Dumb program I made out of convenience that allows you to open a Twitch.tv stream in VLC/other media players using Livestreamer but simultaneously opens the chat in a new browser tab. Also uses EasyGUI (built in) which is my highest level of understanding of Python GUI. This is garbage but maybe it can be improved.

Download for Livestreamer (Simplified BSD): http://docs.livestreamer.io/install.html

Sorry for how bad this is. Ideally I want a program that can open a stream using Livestreamer as well as open the Twitch popout chat in a new window. Currently it opens the stream (in best quality only) and opens the chat in a new browser tab, not the popout chat.
