# TTV-Opener
Dumb program I made out of convenience that allows you to open a Twitch.tv stream in VLC/other media players using Livestreamer but simultaneously opens the chat in a new browser tab. Also requires EasyGUI which is my highest level of understanding of Python GUI. This is garbage but maybe it can be improved.

Download for Livestreamer (Simplified BSD): http://docs.livestreamer.io/install.html

Download for EasyGUI (Modified BSD): http://easygui.sourceforge.net/

Also it requires the webbrowser module: https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.4/Lib/webbrowser.py


Sorry for how bad this is. Ideally I want a program that can open a stream using Livestreamer as well as open the Twitch popout chat in a new window. Currently it opens the stream (in best quality only) and opens the chat in a new browser tab, not the popout chat.
