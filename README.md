# TTV-Opener
Dumb program I made out of convenience that allows you to open a Twitch.tv stream in VLC using Livestreamer but simultaneously opens the chat in a new browser tab. Also requires EasyGUI which is my highest level of understanding of Python GUI. This is garbage but maybe it can be improved.
